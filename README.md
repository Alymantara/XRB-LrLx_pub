# XRB-LrLx_pub
Quick LrLx plot based on published data

This is a simple script to make LrLx plot and manually add data points (e.g., comparing a new source with the sample).

This plot is based on [Tetarenko, B., et al. 2016](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...825...10T), [Bahramian et al. 2017](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.467.2199B) and references therein.

Since publication, the following updates have been applied:
- MWC 656 updated based on [Ribo et al. 2017](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...835L..33R)
- EXO 1745-248 added based on [Tetarenko, A., et al. 2016](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.460..345T)
- M62 VLA1 updated based on Bahramian et al. in prep.
